# *fingerture*

### A **Python** web app that generates optimal fingering for piano sheet music,
### accelerating the learning pace for practicioners and non-practicioners with ease.

---

### Pianists can spend hours a day, ensuring that they use only the most appropriate fingerings for each song they include in their repertoires.
### But instead of tediously annotating each note by hand, *fingerture* does all the hard work for you.
### *fingerture* lets users upload their favorite sheet music as MusicXML files, downloadable from common sheet music notation platforms, then proceeds to instantly provide a new, fully annotated copy for them to start practicing!
